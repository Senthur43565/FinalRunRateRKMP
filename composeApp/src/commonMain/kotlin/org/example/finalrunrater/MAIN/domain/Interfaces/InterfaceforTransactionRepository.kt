 **Important Notes**
THIS IS THE 4th STEP IN DEFINING THE INTERFACES

Alright, buddy! Now, let‚Äôs imagine the TransactionRepository is like your super smart toy box that helps you keep track of all the fun things you do with your toys,
except instead of toys, we‚Äôre talking about your bets and money transactions in RunRater!

Get Transactions:
This is like asking your helper to show you all the toys you‚Äôve played with recently.
In the TransactionRepository, you can ask it to show all the bets and transactions you've made‚Äîlike deposits, withdrawals, and bet placements.
It‚Äôs like looking back at all the actions you've taken in the game.

Create Transaction:
Whenever you make a new bet or deposit money to play, it‚Äôs like adding a new toy to the box!
The TransactionRepository helps record each action, like when you put money in to place a bet or withdraw winnings after a successful guess.

Update Transaction Status:
Sometimes, you‚Äôre not quite sure when you‚Äôll play with your toys next, so you update their status to remind yourself!
The TransactionRepository can help you change the status of your bets or transactions. Maybe you placed a bet,
but you‚Äôre still waiting to see if it‚Äôs going to win, or maybe you withdrew your winnings. The TransactionRepository keeps track of the current state so you know exactly where you are in the process.

So, in RunRater, the TransactionRepository is like your best buddy, keeping track of everything you‚Äôve done with your bets,
helping you stay organized and ensuring you never forget which transactions have been completed or are still waiting! Pretty awesome, right? üèèüí∞
