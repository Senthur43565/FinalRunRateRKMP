package org.example.finalrunrater.MAIN.presentation.ui.fragments

// In short:
// Activities are for big, complete screens.
// Fragments are for smaller, reusable parts of those screens.
// Fragments let your app handle changes (like switching tabs or flipping through match details) faster and smarter.
