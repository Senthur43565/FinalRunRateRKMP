 **Important Notes**
THIS IS THE 5th STEP IN DEFINING THE ENTITIES

In the RunRater cricket betting application, a BettingOption adds excitement by letting users pick and predict fun challenges during a match. Here's how it works:

id: A unique identifier for each BettingOption, like a special tag to keep track of it.
matchId: The specific match this BettingOption belongs to (e.g., Team A vs. Team B).
name: The description of the challenge, such as:
‚ÄúWill the next ball be a six?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow many runs will the team score in this over?‚Äù
‚ÄúWho will be the top scorer?‚Äù
odds: The likelihood of the challenge happening, represented as a number.
      Higher odds mean the event is less likely but offers a bigger reward, while lower odds indicate a higher chance but smaller payout.
status: The availability of the BettingOption, such as:
   Active: Open for users to place bets.
   Closed: No longer accepting bets (e.g., after the event occurs).
   Settled: The outcome has been determined.
outcome: The result of the challenge (e.g., "Yes" if the next ball was a six, "No" otherwise).
createdAt: The time when the BettingOption was created.
updatedAt: The most recent time the BettingOption was modified (e.g., odds updated or status changed).

In RunRater, a BettingOption keeps the action engaging by letting users predict key moments in the match and win based on their cricket knowledge and intuition! üèè‚ú®
